It's looking like I need to do this on the server. Canvg apparently cannot
handle this svg (maybe it's a problem with <use>?).

On the server, I tried rsvg-convert and batik's rasterizer command. Only
rasterizer can render correctly, and it requires some modifications to the
CSS and SVG and some CL options:

- the SVG XML needs to contain a default xmlns="http://www.svg.org/2000/svg"
- the CSS needs to be combined into one file
- pass -cssUser $combinedFile.css
